1h1f -r-> 2h1f : HW GID difference, FW same. e.g. performance variants of the same product
1h1f -d-> 1h2f : Use a common HW platform (& partial FW commonality) for multiple products. Usage may not overlap.
1h1f -d-> 2h2f : No measurable overlap in HW or FW even if functionally equivalent to user i.e. Donâ€™t Care, Treat as separate
2h1f -[hidden]d-> 2h2f
