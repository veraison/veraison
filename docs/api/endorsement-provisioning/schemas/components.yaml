            A URI reference [RFC3986] that identifies the problem type.  This
            specification encourages that, when dereferenced, it provide
            human-readable documentation for the problem type (e.g., using HTML
            [W3C.REC-html5-20141028]).  When this member is not present, its
            value is assumed to be "about:blank".
          example: about:blank
        title:
          type: string
          description: >
            A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.  It SHOULD NOT
            change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for
            purposes of localization (e.g., using proactive content
            negotiation; see [RFC7231], Section 3.4).
          example: Not Found
        status:
          type: integer

            The HTTP status code ([RFC7231], Section 6) generated by the
            origin server for this occurrence of the problem.
          example: 404
        detail:
          type: string
          description: >
            A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence
            of the problem.
          example: no active session could be located at the requested URL
        instance:
          type: string
          format: uri
          description: >
            A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of
            the problem.  It may or may not yield further information if
            dereferenced.
